# Differential-Geometry
My notes on the book Differential Geometry by William Graustein, 1935 &amp; 1966

I have updated his mathematical notation to be more modern. I have filled in all details and gaps. This has required me to insert many numbered equations and to insert theorems and equations that I needed for my own understanding. I have added examples of space curves that helped me to understand concepts. I also added motivation and explanation for concepts that I struggled to understand.
